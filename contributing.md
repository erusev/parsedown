### Issues

If you have a question or a feature request feel free to open a new issue here - https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/issues/new.

Checkout existing issues before opening a new one.

### Pull Requests

 * Always open an issue (or comment on existing ones) before working on a pull request.  
   You could later [reference the issue](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) in the pull request.  
   Do not write significat amount of code before discussing it first.  
 * Create a "feature" branch from `master` for your pull request.
 * Create your pull request from your "feature" branch to the `master` branch.
 * Run existing unit tests (with `phpunit`) and write your own. [Travis CI](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) would [take care of PRs automatically](http://blog.travis-ci.com/announcing-pull-request-support/), but you could run the tests locally before that.

### Ignored Files

Do not commit system files, but don't clutter [.gitignore](.gitignore). Use a [useful global .gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files#global-gitignore).
